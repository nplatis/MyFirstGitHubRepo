# My first GitHub repo

This is my first project.

## First steps

Here are some things to do:
 * Learn Git
 * Learn GitHub
   * Go to `github.com`
   * Read some documentation

## Next steps

 1. Create repository
 2. Push some code

```Java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

}
```

This is a very nice for loop.

But let's try something more complex, like a `while` loop.
